## Application specifications and requirements

It’s up to you to decide your project specs and requirements.
One member of each team should be voted to be a Team leader.
Team leaders will discuss with their team member(s) an idea and write down a short description for it, set their goals, and have a clear scope. Your project must use the following:

* Implement a login based system (JWT).
* Use UI Components https://angular.io/resources

**Note**: Chat and e-commerce/cart applications are not allowed. Set a more challenging goal.

## Technical information
* You must use all the technologies we learned in our course (MEAN stack).
* Design your own DB, skeleton, and app structure (let me know if you need help with this). Start by planning your screens and split your work between all members. (use DB as a service – Atlas).
* It’s advised that every team member is responsible for implementing one use-case or project component from start to end.
* All Angular routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign up and sign in routes)
* All Express routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign up and sign in routes)
* Team leaders will create a new Git repo and invite their team members as contributors. All team members must push to the same repo. Use branching. It's a good practice to merge your branches when a feature is ready, waiting for one final merge may cause your project to break and harder to merge.
* A daily push is required for each member to track your code and performance. If you miss a push that will affect your final grade.
* Do not push any private key of any service to Git. (If found, your account will be terminated and you may be legally sued by service providers). Write your keys in a config file (npm i dotenv) and add the filename to .gitignore
* Do not spend more than two hours on a problem, move on, or find an alternative.

## Extra points
To qualify for 5 extra points to be added to your final grade, your project must include one or more of the following: (1 additional point per feature)

* Using featured lazy-loaded modules in the frontend and proper REST design in the backend.
* Using state management library ([NgRx](https://ngrx.io/)) or any other similar state management solution ([Redux](https://redux.js.org/)).
* Using Angular [Material](https://material.angular.io/) for UI components and project layout. This does not mean using a few components but rather having the project layout meet the industry standards in web design.
* Using [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or any other similar service for image upload (backend and frontend).
* Your project is hosted online and accessible with a public URL.
